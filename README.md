# VGA Output

## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing a custom VGA controller using an FPGA, specifically the AFTx07 chip developed by Purdue SoCET Lab. The goal is to generate VGA video output from an FPGA system, which can be used for various display applications. The project involves the integration of a custom VGA controller, RAM, and DACs to produce video signals that are compatible with VGA monitors. The system is designed to store pixel data in RAM, retrieve it efficiently, and output it as a video signal.

The project aims to provide a hands-on experience with FPGA-based video output, enhancing the understanding of how digital systems interface with display technology. In the future, the project may be extended to support HDMI or USB video interfaces for broader compatibility.
